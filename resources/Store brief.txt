Design a basic web store, it should have items/orders and users. It should use mysql as a database, a orm and ember js
IT should be deigned to use MVC
It should have a api
and if you have time a UI
-  1 point, design a basic schema (can be as orm models)
-  2 point create basic API
-  3 create basic UI
Should use a group git hub project/ that has a git ignore... should not  track any uneeded files


How do you interact with the store?

What type of store do we want?
Is this about a one to many DB relationship?
How many products?
What relationships might we find in the database?
How basic or advanced is this app?
How long have we got to finish it?
Do we need to mock up the front end before we start?
I think it should look good
Shall we use the DB tool Trent uses to design the schema?
How many products?

The shop

What out of scope?

Core functionality from the database?
- Search phones based on different properties
- Add phones to a basket
- View the basket
- Take things out of the basket
- Suggest accessories/or add accesories
